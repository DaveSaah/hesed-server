The Father's heart is towards the wellbeing of His children. A few weeks back,
the Lord put a word in my spirit and I want to share it with you.

## Disclaimer

There will be a mixture of my words and God's words. Pay close attention to know
who is speaking. However, if you treat this as a word from God to you and your
community of believers without regard to this author, you will be fine.

## The Message

I love it when my children form small groups to fellowship together. But some
lack one thing -- **A Sanctuary**. I want the fellowships to be a sanctuary.
There are some problems my children are in that could be avoided if they had
a safe space. In **Hebrews** I mentioned that *"encourage one another daily as
long as it is called today lest, you'd be led astray by the deceitfulness of sin."*
You were never designed to live life alone. If you have something going in your life,
whether good or bad, why can't you share it with your siblings? Remember my word,
*"In the multitude of counselors, there is safety"*. You need each other. Let the
issues taking place in your life be known to your brethren. There is no condemnation.
There is a lot I want to do, but if you don't share them, your isolation will lead
to more hurt, and eventually cause you to be deceived by sin.

## The Essence of a Sanctuary

I wanted to search for the meaning of a sanctuary from the Hebrew and Greek, but
there is a verse here that the Lord brought out. He said, "No need; share this."
The scripture concerns what will happen when you follow my will to create a sanctuary
for my children. **Psalms 20:2** and it says, *"May He send you help from the Sanctuary
(His dwelling place) and support and strengthen you from Zion."*

## What To Do?

If the community of believers you are in don't have an environment of a sanctuary,
then meet with them and discuss this matter. Let the Holy Spirit guide you. How do
I know the community of believers you are in is not a sanctuary, a safe place? Here
are a few pointers:

- You suffer alone.
- You can't ask for prayer.
- You cannot share when you have moments of weakness.
- Share testimonies to encourage one another.
- Life decisions are made without carrying others along. What type of decisions?
  - Moving to a new place.
  - Started a dating relationship.
  - Taking on a career.
  - Things related to academics.
  - Cutting people off from your life.

It might sound like that will make others intrusive in your life. Trust me, many
have fallen and are struggling because they didn't have this environment.

## Conclusion

It is my prayer that our cell groups, fellowships be made into sanctuary. Again,
**Psalms 20:2** -- *"May He send you help from the Sanctuary (His dwelling place)
and support and strengthen you from Zion."* Do not neglect the gathering and the
advantage you have being in a community. One may chase a 1000, but two will put
10,000 to flight.
