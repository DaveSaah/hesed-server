## Introduction

When people are first led to Christ, they become sons of God. As sure as this
truth is, so also is the truth of growth (2 Peter 3:18). Jesus called us to disciple nations,
to make disciples (Matthew 28:19-20). That means after they are saved, it is our responsibility to
instruct and guide them to learn the ways of God. Why we do not see the
supernatural overflowing as it should be, is because we led people to Christ and
left them to fend for themselves. It shouldn't be so.

You who are spiritually mature, guide those who are still finding their way in
the Lord that they may also come into full sonship (Hebrews 5:12). Faith is based on the premise
of belief; but how can they believe if they have not heard, and how can they hear
unless there is a preacher--unless there is someone to tell them (Romans 10:14). When you see
someone not walking in the ways of God, especially your fellow brethren, see it
as they are not walking in faith because no one taught them how. Then you go and
teach them. When Jesus saw the multitudes, He did not see people who do not know
what they are about and said in His heart: "Look at this people doing whatever
they want". No! The scriptures say, "He had compassion on them and saw them as
sheep without a shepherd" (Matthew 9:36). A shepherd knows the condition of their flocks and
diligently seeks to understand the state of their herds (Proverbs 27:23).

For the children still maturing in the faith, if you are reading this, understand
that you need to be taught so that you can deal fully as mature sons. As long as
you are still a child, it is necessary that you submit to sound teaching. As
Apostle Peter puts it: "As newborn babies, let us crave the pure sincere milk of
the word that ye may grow thereby" (1 Peter 2:2). A baby doesn't provide their own milk.

Be humble and learn.

## The Prayer

Whether one is a parent or has the privilege of nurturing God's children, you can
pray this over them while you intercede. If you are the one who is being nurtured
into full sonship, you can pray this over yourself as well by personalising the prayer:

_Give **[Name of person]** a heart that loves instruction and yields to discipline.
Let not **[Name of person]** heart despise correction and reproof. Give **[Name
of person]** a hearing heart to listen to your voice through the voice of your
teachers. That **[Name of person's]** ears incline to those that instruct him/her
that he/she may be built up in the ways of God._

As John said: "This is the confidence that we have. That if we pray according
to the will of God, He hears us and that we have what we say" (1 John 5:14-15). Amen!
