{{< accordion "Hebrews 3:12" >}}
\[Therefore beware\] brethren, take care, lest there be in any one of you a
wicked, unbelieving heart \[which refuses to cleave to, trust in, and rely on
Him\], leading you to turn away and desert or stand aloof from the living God.
{{< /accordion >}}

How can you tell that you are beginning to develop an unbelieving heart? An
unbelieving heart is a heart that refuses to cleave to, trust in, and rely on
God. When that happens, it leads us away from God, causing us to stand aloof
from Him. To stand aloof means: "To stand at or from a distance, but within
view, or at a small distance; apart; away (reserved and remote; either
physically or emotionally distant)".

{{< accordion "Hebrews 3:13" >}}
But instead warn (admonish, urge and encourage) one another everyday, as long as
it is called Today, that none of you may be hardened \[into settled rebellion\]
by the deceitfulness of sin \[by the fraudulence, the strategen, the trickery
which the delusive glamour of his sin may play on him\].
{{< /accordion >}}

Faith doesn’t come by having heard, faith comes by hearing. Admonish, urge and
encourage each other everyday does not mean someone always tell you about the
Lord. If your only source of knowledge of who God is comes from what others have
said about Him, it’s good but don’t stay there; it’s a shaky foundation. Get to
know God for yourself. Seek to have a personal revelation of Jesus so you can
also share it with others. You cannot give what you don’t have.

Sharing about the Lord daily is to remind us of Him and to continue to have
faith, because faith comes by hearing and hearing, and the priority of hearing
should be the word of Christ.

{{< accordion "Hebrews 3:19" >}}
So we see that they were not able to enter \[into His rest\] because of their
unwillingness to adhere to and trust in and rely on God; [unbelief had shut
them out.

{{< accordion "Romans 10:3" >}}
For being ignorant of the righteousness that God ascribes \[which makes one
acceptable to Him in word, thought and deed\] and seeking to establish a
righteousness (a means of salvation) of their own, they did not obey or submit
themselves of God’s righteousness.
{{< /accordion >}}

The righteousness which God ascribes makes one acceptable to Him in word, thought
and deed. **Romans 10:8**. The message, the basis and object of faith is
Christ. If you talk about faith in God without talking about Christ, then it is
not the message that God preaches. **Romans 10:9; Romans 4:24-25**.

The guarantee that all our sins are forgive is the death of Jesus on the cross
and the guarantee that we have been made righteous is Him being raised from the
dead by God. Your justification before God is secure in the fact that Christ
lives today. Do you believe that God raised Jesus from the dead? Then rest,
because as long as He lives, you are righteous, you are acceptable before God.
It is not enough to know, you need to believe to enjoy the fruits of he finished
worked of Christ.

Sharing about the Lord daily is to remind us of Him and to continue to have
faith, because faith comes by hearing and hearing, and the priority of hearing
should be the word of Christ.

**Romans 10:10-11; Romans 10:14-15; Hebrews 4:2**. When we fail to lean on the
entire personality of God, in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom
and goodness; the message we hear, the promises God made in His word will not be
of benefit to us. Absolute means: "Free of restrictions, limitations,
qualifications or conditions; unconditional; unrestricted by laws, a
constitution or parliamentary or judicial; legally unlimited in power; certain;
free from doubt or uncertainty."

Those who have absolute belief in God will enter into His rest. **Hebrews 4:10-11**.

{{< accordion "Hebrews 4:15-16" >}}
For we do not have a high priest who is unable to understand and sympathize and
have a shared feeling with our weaknesses and infirmities and liability to the
assaults of temptation, but One who has been tempted in every respect as we are,
yet without sinning.

Let us then fearlessly and confidently and boldly draw near to the throne of
grace (the throne of God’s unmerited favour to us, sinners), that we may receive
mercy \[for our failures\] and find grace to help in good time for every need
\[appropriate help and well-timed help, coming in just when we need it\].

The verse that started it all: **Hebrews 4:11**.
