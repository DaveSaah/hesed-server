The agenda for 2025 is for salvation. At church, this vision was confirmed with
the theme: **The 3rd Day**. One of the elements in the vision message is 
Hezekiah. These are my notes of the story of Hezekiah in the light of the 3rd
day.

## Notice

Kindly read the entire 2 Kings 19 & 20 to get the full context.

## Hezekiah's Attitude

*2 Kings 19*. Whenever Hezekiah received a report, his first response is to go 
to the House of the Lord to pray. Even his servants go to enquire about their
master from a prophet.

One of Hezekiah's prayer's ending:

{{< quote-center >}}
**2 Kings 19:19 AMP** -- *"Now, O Lord our God, please, save us from his hand
so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know [without any doubt] that You
alone, O Lord, are God."*
{{< /quote-center >}}

In addition to his attitude of always taking things up to the Lord in prayer,
His end desire is that all may know that the Lord alone is God. The world does
not know the Lord, they are only aware of God. From a personal space to a
general space. Yes, he asked for himself, but not only was he saved; the enemy
had an opportunity to know God.

This is an interesting scripture I noted:

{{< quote-center >}}
**2 Kings 19:29-20 AMP** -- *"Then this shall be the sign [of these things] to
you [Hezekiah]: this year you will eat what growss of itself, in the second year
what springs up voluntarily, and in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards,
and eat their fruit. The survivors who remain of the house of Judah will again 
take root downward and bear fruit upward."*
{{< /quote-center >}}

*2 Kings 20*. When he received news again, he turned to the Lord. In Hezekiah's
prayer:

- How I have walked before You in faithfulness and truth and with a whole heart
[entirely devoted to You].
- Done what is good in your sight.

God's response:

{{< quote-center >}}
**2 Kings 20:5-6 AMP** -- *"Go back and tell Hezekiah the leader of My people, 
'Thus says the Lord, the God of David your father (ancestor): "I have heard your
prayer, I have seen your tears. Behold, I am healing you; on the third day you 
shall go up to the house of the Lord" I will add fifteen years to your life and
save you and this city [Jerusalem] from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I
will protect this city for My own sake and for My servant David's sake."'"*
{{< /quote-center >}}

Hezekiah asked for a sign: **2 Kings 20:8 AMP - Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "What
will be the sign that the Lord will [completely] heal me, and that I shall go
up to the house of the Lord on the third day?"** Isaiah prayed and the shadow on
the sundial of Ahaz went back 10 degrees.
