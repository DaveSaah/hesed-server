A message I prepared to give on September 8, 2024.

What do you think about the title? What do you have to say? For most people, saying
Abraham is righteous is no problem. But here's a catch Lot was righteous too.
Read Genesis chapters 12, 13, and 19 to get the context of the story of Abraham
and Lot.

**2 Peter 2:1-8**; (main verse: **7-8**). The Bible calls Lot righteous.
**Romans 4:3**. The Bible calls Abraham righteous. When God looks at a
90-year-old Christian who is saved, and a day old Christian, there is no
difference. Or we look at two Christians who got saved at a similar time and one
appears to us to be ‘doing well’ in faith while the other is ‘getting by’ — God
sees two righteous people regardless.

I’m not the only one who thinks this way. Peter and Abraham said it themselves in
**2 Peter 2:7-8** and **Genesis 18:23-26**. For Abraham’s sake: what was his advocacy
for? The answer? That the righteous be saved. God, Abraham, Peter and I agree
that Lot is a righteous man. If you have been with me for a while, you’ll often
hear me say: "What I’m sharing will not necessarily put you higher, but there are
two kinds of believers — Righteous Abraham and Righteous Lot."

Both people are saved, so this is not a salvation message to say that Abraham
will be saved and Lot will not be. No, no, no… In fact, you can choose not to be
Righteous Abraham and you will still find grace, mercy, favour, be blessed and
saved as a Righteous Lot. Those who want to be righteous Abraham can take notes,
listen, and later meditate on what will be shared.

{{< quote-center >}}
There are two types of believers: Righteous Abraham and Righteous Lot.
{{< /quote-center >}}

Now, what then is the difference? Knowledge. Abraham knew the person of God, Lot
knew about God. This question for us is: Do you know the person of God, or you
know about God? The difference in knowledge is captured in their revelation and actions.

**Genesis 18:1-3**. Abraham saw 3 men and addressed them as ‘My Lord (singular)’.
**Genesis 18:5**.
**Genesis 18:33; Genesis 19:1-2**. Lot saw them and said, ‘My Lords (plural)’.
He had no revelation.

The Lord can only address you on the level of your revelation. When the story of
Abraham was being told, the Bible said the Lord appeared. On Lot’s part, He said,
‘two angels came to him’. We see that knowledge affects the revelation and the
revelation brings forth different experiences of God. Abraham is not greater than
Lot in the sense of what we term as ‘greatness’. Neither is Lot greater than
Abraham. They are all righteous before God. So also, I am not greater than you;
neither are you greater than me; we are all righteous before God. What changes is
our experience of Him.

God affects our revelation of God and the consequence is a different experience
of God.

Now, what will you do? We can remain as we are and receive all the blessings of
God; we can know about God and believe in Him because we trust that He is God.
Or **2 Peter 3:18** — Grow in grace, grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord
and saviour Jesus Christ; where you don’t just believe, but you know whom you
have believed; where your faith is not based on ‘I hope it happens’ or a wish
that God will do something for you, but you understand that the quality of faith
is based on knowledge. Faith is not a feeling, but is very logical. It is based
on facts — you know why you believe what you believe; you understand the will of
God, you walk in the Lord and are able to share that with others.

{{< quote-center >}}
The quality of faith is based on knowledge — the knowledge of the person of God.

We see God intervene for Abraham’s sake. But we don’t see God intervene for Lot’s
sake. (I am talking of the one taking the initiative). Here is another question
to ask yourself: “Can your faith extend beyond what benefits you to go and
benefit others?” Are you willing to grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus?
Righteous Abraham and Righteous Lot — whom will you become?

Why is this all important? There are 3 levels of the will of God. **Romans 12:2**:

- Good,
- acceptable,
- and perfect.

Let me give you an example to grasp this: In regards to our body, this is God’s will:

- Going to the doctor — acceptable.
- Receiving healing — good.
- Being in health — perfect.

Notice how all the levels of God’s will results in you being well, but the
experience of it differs.

Here is another example: Marriage:

- To get married to have sex — acceptable.
- To get married for companionship — good.
- To get married to serve God together — perfect.

All these will result to good, but the experience of it is different. I can marry
to serve God with a woman, in the midst of it, we will have sex, we will have
companionship. The perfect will of God is all-encompassing. The perfect will of
God is not necessarily above His good and acceptable will — all is God’s will,
but the experience of it is different.

Let me give you another example you may be more familiar with as believers. When
we got saved, our lives fulfill the Law, right? Our lives compared to a man who
keeps the law is not any different.

- The Law says, “Do not commit adultery”.
- Grace says, “Love your wife”.

Both husbands above will not commit adultery; but one is doing it because of the
Law (the scripture says the Law brings one under bondage). I can choose to not
commit adultery because the Law says so, but that does not mean I will love my
wife. It doesn’t mean I will show her grace in her shortcomings.

For the one who chose the love their wife — I love my wife and because I love my
wife, I do not want to commit adultery. Both husbands fulfilled the Law, but the
experiences are different. This example reminds me of **2 Corinthians 5:14**. It
says, "The Love of Christ constraints us". As Jesus said, "I came not to destroy
the Law, but to fulfill it" \[**Matthew 5:17**\]. He left us will a new commandment,
"Love one another" \[**John 15:12**\]. Why? Because "Love is the fulfillment of the
Law" \[**Romans 13:10**\].

{{< quote-center >}}
Love is the fulfillment of the law.
{{< /quote-center >}}

Building on the example of marriage, I can pray hoping that God answers and
another prays knowing that God answers because the Bible Says, “if we pray
according to His will, He hears us” \[**1 John 5:14-15**\]. When God answers
both, one will be in uncertainty and what ifs, while the other is sure and
certain. What is the difference: knowing who God is. That is why this message is
so significant.

How can we bring this word to life? Do I just believe I am Righteous Abraham and
hope to change? No, no, no. Take the word of God and get to know Jesus. For those
of us who do not know how to draw Jesus out of scriptures or even in our everyday
life by ourselves, do not worry. You can take sermons that talk about Jesus, take
notes, write down the references, then meditate on the word. Through meditation,
the Holy Spirit will clarify things to you — follow His leading till it is no
longer the revelation of this man of God or that man of God or even what just the
Bible says; it becomes your revelation.

I love Paul. He said, “My Gospel” \[**Romans 16:25**\]. He owned it. Own the
revelation of Jesus Christ. That cannot happen without knowledge. Get to know the
scriptures, memorise them, apply them, meditate — it starts from there. Continue
in it will you are able to look at anything and bring Jesus accurately out of it.

Now, you have received an amazing message and as the wonderful person as you are,
you want to share it with someone else. At least, you now have this in writing so
you can simply share the link. What I am trying to say is, Acts 1:1. The Bible
says, “What Jesus did do and teach”. See the fruits in your life, then teach. The
idea of the Holy Spirit regarding this: Teach from a place of certainty, not a wish.

{{< quote-center >}}
Do, and then teach.

That is where I’ll end today. God bless you for your time and for listening.
