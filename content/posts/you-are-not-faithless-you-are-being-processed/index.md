You have faith for a certain outcome. Yes, most of the times you get that 
outcome. It happens again and again and again. There are times where your faith
and what you're seeing is not matching. The processing does not indicate a lack
of faith. You spoke to the fig tree today and nothing happened. But it began 
thirty fold, then sixty fold and then a hundred fold. Do not give up because
sometimes, the hundred fold is the next morning. Faith is now, so we demand 
that it happens now. It won't always happen now, some are processes and that 
not make your faith less valuable. It's a question of hope. Hope is an anchor 
for our soul. You don't need an anchor unless there's a probability of the ship
swaying away. 

Do not lose heart; hold onto hope; remain steadfast and unmovable. Allow God to
process you. It is in God's processing that God's character is built. Don't get
too hard on yourself. Follow me and keep your head up: **"You are not faithless,
you're just being processed"**.
