{{< accordion "Romans 1:17" >}}
For in the Gospel a righteousness which God ascribes is revealed, both springing
from faith and leading to faith \[disclosed through the way of faith that arouses
to more faith\]. As it is written, The man who through faith is just and upright
shall live and shall live by faith.
{{< /accordion >}}

A righteousness that is not ascribed from God is not by faith and does not lead
to faith. This means that the righteousness which comes from God must satisfy
these two conditions:

1. Come by faith.
2. Lead to more faith.

If any is not satisfied, then that form of righteousness is not that which God
ascribes. Why would the righteousness of God require faith? Where is faith
required? Why did God choose faith? Trust and confidence in Jesus springs from
faith in God.

{{< accordion "Hebrews 11:1" >}}
Now faith is the assurance (the confirmation, the title deed) of the things \[we\]
hope for, being proof of the things [we] do not see and the conviction of their
reality \[faith perceiving as real fact what is not revealed to the senses\].
{{< /accordion >}}

Faith is required where something is not revealed to the senses. God chose faith
so that we can have trust and confidence in His Son which springs faith in Him.
The righteousness of God requires faith because the evidence will not be
immediately revealed to the senses. In other words, physical evidence may
contradict the reality of faith. Nonetheless, faith is required to believe the
truth of God’s word instead of what our senses tell us. That is why the righteousness
of God is by faith.

{{< accordion "Habakkuk 2:4" >}}
Look at the proud; his soul is not straight or right within him, but the
\[rigidly\] just and the \[uncompromisingly\] righteous man shall live by his faith
and in his faithfulness.
{{< /accordion >}}

Does faith lead to humility? It seems people who are self-righteous breed pride
within themselves, as a result, his soul is not straight or right within him. If
the Bible is contrasting self-righteousness and the righteousness of God, could
it be that those who are righteous by faith are humble? Faith does not deny the
reality of a situation but chooses to believe in someone or something with a
stronger foundation; that which does not fail. The righteousness of God brings
us to the end of ourselves and makes us realise our need for God and leads us to
trust Him and have confidence in His Word that He has made us righteous by His
Son’s finished work. We cannot make ourselves righteous, but believing that we
are justified by faith, that’s the righteousness that comes from God— and this
righteousness starts from faith and leads to more faith.

This is the life God wants us to live: not for us to be justified by our works
but to believe in the God who justifies the ungodly.

This is the life God wants us to live: not for us to be justified by our works
but to believe in the God who justifies the ungodly. We do not need to be godly
to be justified by God. Just as we are, we are accepted and made righteous when
we receive Jesus. That is not because God is soft on sin … NO! This is made
possible because Jesus died for the forgiveness of all our sins and was raised
from the dead to declare us righteous. The proof of our sins being forgiven is
the death of Jesus on the cross. The proof of us being made righteous before God
is the resurrection of Jesus from the dead.

This is the righteousness by faith and the just shall live and they live by
faith. This is what it means to live in the grace of God. It is the unearned,
unmerited and undeserved favor of God.
