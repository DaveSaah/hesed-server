## What is Hesed Server?

![A note from your heavenly Father](feature.jpeg)

**Hesed** is the Hebrew word for love. It is so rich that it cannot be explained
with one word.

- Theologian John Oswalt said hesed is “… a completely undeserved
  kindness and generosity”.
- Hesed is not just a feeling, but an action. It “intervenes on behalf of loved
  ones and comes to their rescue”, according to author Lois Tverberg.

Hesed is not a romantic, infatuation kind of love. It is a faithful, loyal and reliable
love put to action. And most importantly, hesed is the unfailing love God has for
YOU.

It is my prayer that as you read/watch the content on this website, God's Hesed will
be served to your spirit and blossom into a love for Him and the Church.
